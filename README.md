This repository contains my work related to the analysis of a dataset of molecular crystals.

`benzene_finder_from_tags.py` contains the code used to find crystals of interest and create ellipsoidal representations of them
`benzene_xtal_analysis.ipynb` contains most of the code used to analyze and visualize the data
`data_reader.py` contains code used to read in the original dataset's XYZ files, which ASE's built-in function wasn't able to do.
`data/` contains the original dataset.
`output/` contains most of the files created along the way, including the ellipsoidal frames representing benzene-containing crystals, visualizations of data, and Chemiscope input files.
